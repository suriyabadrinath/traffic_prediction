# Road Safety Analysis

• Engineered Road Safety prediction system by building SQL Database from data incorporated from previous accident records and queried relevant results for different domains 

• Built a custom website that links to the said database to visualize the results of the queries

**Goal/Objective:**

By examining the characteristics of the accident information, the number of big accidents is to be decreased. There may be one or more specific causes, such as poor lighting or hazardous road conditions, that contribute to an increase in accidents. To pinpoint the precise circumstances that cause the majority of accidents, we will evaluate the dataset. The main difference in tackling these problems comes up due to the difference between a Database Management System and excel data files. An excel spreadsheet is simply an electronic graph with rows and columns containing data, with which it is possible to organize and select data. Whereas a diverse Database Management System holds a collection of interrelated data and helps link and organize data into tables and relations, which can draw significant results.


**Database Implementation:** 

We have created 7 tables called RoadType, Severity, RoadSurfaceConditions, LightConditions, Accident, WeatherConditions and AccidentDetails

**Attribute Description:**
